**Interest Concession under Model Education loan scheme** –

- 1% interest concession be provided to the loanees, if the interest is serviced regularly as and when applied during the study period when repayment holiday specified for interest / repayment under the scheme. In other word, **the option of servicing the interest is with the borrower**. The concession is available for the moratorium period only. However, minimum applicable ROI shouldn’t be below RLLR as floor rate.
- As a uniform procedure, branches should offer the option to the borrowers either to service the interest during the moratorium period as and when applied and avail 1 % concession or opt for the repayment of interest together with principal after completion of the course/moratorium. Needless to say that in later option, no interest concessions is to be provided.

**Please Note: Under both the conditions, the repayment start date in CBS (both interest and principal) should start after completion of Moratorium period only.**

- In respect of borrowers availing 1 % interest rate concession, branch should apply Interest at specified rate (without any concession) as per sanction letter. Branch should ensure that the interest is serviced as and when applied. Servicing of interest means repayment of interest amount debited to the loan account within 30 days. In eligible cases, at the time of regeneration of repayment schedule one month before repayment start date, manually interest @1% per annum will be reversed & credited to SB Account of the Borrower.
- For the purpose **BGL – 76500 -** Interest Received on Term Loan is to be adjusted through interest adjustment.
- In case borrower defaults in repayment of interest on due date for any particular month, interest concession is not to be provided for that month and on servicing of interest for any subsequent month together with interest for defaulted month(s), concession is to be provided for the month in respect of which interest has been serviced.

## Bank of Maharashtra Home Loan EMI Calculator – How to Calculate Bank of Maharashtra Home Loan EMI?

To calculate the Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) for your Bank of Maharashtra home loan, you can use the formula provided:

**EMI** = \[P x R x (1+R)^N\] / \[(1+R)^N-1\]

Where:

P = Loan amount: This is the principal amount you borrow from the bank. It represents the total amount of money you need for your home loan.

R = Interest rate per month: This is the monthly interest rate applicable on your loan amount. To calculate the monthly interest rate, you need to divide the annual interest rate by 12 (12 months in a year).

N = Loan tenure in months: This is the total number of months you choose to repay your home loan. It is calculated by multiplying the number of years by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

**Example:**

Let’s say you have taken a Bank of Maharashtra home loan for Rs. 30 lakh at an annual interest rate of 8.60% for a tenure of 20 years.

**Calculate the monthly interest rate (R):**

Monthly Interest Rate = Annual Interest Rate / 12

R = 8.60% / 12 = 0.0071667 (approx.)

**Calculate the loan tenure in months (N):**

Loan Tenure in Months = Loan Tenure in Years x 12

N = 20 years x 12 = 240 months

**Plug the values into the EMI formula:**

EMI = \[30,00,000 x 0.0071667 x (1+0.0071667)^240\] / \[(1+0.0071667)^240-1\]

**Calculate the EMI using a calculator or spreadsheet:**

EMI = \[30,00,000 x 0.0071667 x 3.409203\] / 2.409203

EMI =  72,914.91 (approx.)

So, the Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) for your Bank of Maharashtra home loan of Rs. 30 lakh, with an annual interest rate of 8.60% and a tenure of 20 years, would be approximately Rs.  72,914.91 (approx). This amount is payable every month for the entire loan tenure until the loan is fully repaid.

## Factors that Affect the Bank of Maharashtra Home Loan Interest Rate

- **Credit Score:** A higher credit score indicates good creditworthiness, leading to lower interest rates as it reduces the risk for the bank.
- **Loan Amount and Tenure:** Larger loan amounts or longer tenures may result in higher interest rates due to increased risk for the lender.
- **Income and Employment Stability:** Stable and higher income, along with a secure job, can lead to lower interest rates as it assures the bank of the borrower’s repayment capacity.
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio:** A lower LTV ratio (loan amount compared to the property’s value) may result in better interest rates as it reduces the bank’s risk.
- **Market Conditions:** Prevailing economic conditions, inflation rates, and monetary policies can influence interest rates.

## Tips to Avail Bank of Maharashtra Home Loan at Lower Interest

- **Improve Credit Score:** Maintain a good credit score by paying bills on time, reducing outstanding debts, and avoiding defaults.
- **Higher Down Payment:** Make a higher down payment, reducing the loan amount and resulting in a lower LTV ratio.
- **Stable Employment:** Demonstrate stable employment history to enhance your credibility as a borrower.
- **Compare Offers:** Research and compare interest rates and loan terms from different lenders to find the best deal.
- **Negotiate with the Bank:** Discuss your eligibility and financial position with the bank to negotiate for lower interest rates based on your profile.
- **Opt for Shorter Tenure:** Choose a shorter loan tenure if possible, as it may lead to a reduced interest burden.
- **Balance Transfer:** Consider transferring your existing home loan to Bank of Maharashtra if they offer better interest rates and terms.

By considering these factors and following these tips, borrowers can increase their chances of availing a Bank of Maharashtra home loan at a lower interest rate, resulting in more affordable EMIs and overall cost savings.

# Retail Loans

#### [IMPORTANT NOTIFICATION FOR EMI BASED PERSONAL LOAN BORROWERS\ \ (Including Housing, Vehicle, Education Loan etc.)](https://bankofmaharashtra.in/retail-loans\#accordion-1)

In the event of change in the benchmark rate (RLLR, MLCR & Base Rate), the Interest Rate in Personal loan accounts will also undergo change.

Upward revision in benchmark rate will result in consequent increase of interest rate in the above related loans. The customers will have the following options in order to negate the rise in rate of interest.

a) To pay lumpsum amount to continue with existing EMI & Tenor.

b) To increase the Loan Tenor (within permissible tenor & Age limit)

c) To increase the EMI to pay the loan within the existing tenor.

d) Combination of any of the above.

e) Switchover of loan to Fixed Rate regime (Applicable fixed ROI slabs & charges thereof are displayed at Bank’s website)

f) Prepayment of loan, either in part or in full, to accommodate the increased Interest

**Note -** The Customers are requested to submit revised Standing Instruction / NACH mandate at their Home branch in case of EMI increase.

# Bank of Maharashtra Home Loans for Construction of Houses in India: A Detailed Guide

![Bank of Maharashtra Home Loans for Construction of Houses in India: A Detailed Guide](https://bankofmaharashtra.in/writereaddata/defaultimages/loader.svg)

Building your dream home from the ground up is a rewarding experience, but it requires significant financial investment. Bank of Maharashtra offers the [**Maha Super Housing Loan Scheme**](https://bankofmaharashtra.in/maha-super-housing-loan-scheme-for-construction-acquiring), designed to support individuals in constructing their dream homes or even taking a [**home loan for plot purchase and construction thereon**](https://bankofmaharashtra.in/maha-super-housing-loan-scheme-for-purchase-plot-construction-thereon). This comprehensive guide will walk you through the features, benefits, and application process of this loan. This blog will also help to understand the documents for home loan procedure.

## **Features of Home Construction Loans**

The Maha Super Housing Loan Scheme by Bank of Maharashtra is tailored to cater to various needs related to home construction. Here are some of its prominent features:

1. **Purpose**: The loan can be used for the home loan for construction of house, purchasing a new or existing house/flat, and making extensions or renovations to an existing property.
2. **Loan Amount**: The loan amount is determined based on the applicant's repayment capacity and the value of the property. It aims to cover the complete construction cost, making it a comprehensive financial solution.
3. **Interest Rates**: The home construction loan interest rate is competitive, starting from 8.10% per annum. This attractive rate makes the loan affordable and accessible to a wide range of borrowers.
4. **Repayment Tenure**: The repayment period can extend up to 30 years, providing flexibility and reducing the monthly EMI burden.
5. **Security**: The loan requires a mortgage of the property being financed. Additional security might be required depending on the loan amount and specific case assessments.

**Home Loan Vs Construction Loan – Key Differences**

While both home loans and construction loans aim to finance property-related expenses, they serve different purposes and come with distinct terms. Let’s understand the difference between the home loan for construction on land and home loan specific to purchasing a ready home.

- **Purpose**: A home loan is generally used for purchasing a fully constructed house or flat. In contrast, a home loan for construction on land is specifically for building a house on an owned plot.
- **Disbursement**: Home loans are usually disbursed in a lump sum. Construction loans, however, are disbursed in stages based on the progress of the construction.

### **Eligibility and Documentation**

[**Home construction loan eligibility**](https://bankofmaharashtra.in/personal-banking/loans/home-loan) criteria include:

- Resident Indian citizens, NRIs, PIOs, and OCIs are eligible.
- The applicant should have a stable income and a good credit score.
- The loan amount and eligibility are determined based on the applicant’s repayment capacity and property value.

The [**home loan process documents**](https://bankofmaharashtra.in/blogs/what-are-the-documents-required-for-home-loan) required for the application include:

- Proof of identity (Aadhar card, PAN card, passport, etc.).
- Proof of residence (utility bills, rent agreement, etc.).
- Proof of income (salary slips, IT returns, etc.).
- Property-related documents (title deed, sale agreement, etc.).

- 1% interest concession be provided to the loanees, if the interest is serviced regularly as and when applied during the study period when repayment holiday specified for interest / repayment under the scheme. In other word, **the option of servicing the interest is with the borrower**. The concession is available for the moratorium period only. However, minimum applicable ROI shouldn’t be below RLLR as floor rate.
- As a uniform procedure, branches should offer the option to the borrowers either to service the interest during the moratorium period as and when applied and avail 1 % concession or opt for the repayment of interest together with principal after completion of the course/moratorium. Needless to say that in later option, no interest concessions is to be provided.

**Please Note: Under both the conditions, the repayment start date in CBS (both interest and principal) should start after completion of Moratorium period only.**

- In respect of borrowers availing 1 % interest rate concession, branch should apply Interest at specified rate (without any concession) as per sanction letter. Branch should ensure that the interest is serviced as and when applied. Servicing of interest means repayment of interest amount debited to the loan account within 30 days. In eligible cases, at the time of regeneration of repayment schedule one month before repayment start date, manually interest @1% per annum will be reversed & credited to SB Account of the Borrower.
- For the purpose **BGL – 76500 -** Interest Received on Term Loan is to be adjusted through interest adjustment.
- In case borrower defaults in repayment of interest on due date for any particular month, interest concession is not to be provided for that month and on servicing of interest for any subsequent month together with interest for defaulted month(s), concession is to be provided for the month in respect of which interest has been serviced.

## Bank of Maharashtra Home Loan Types

The bank has a host of schemes under the home loan segment to cater to a wide clientele of resident Indians. The main housing loan and other variants are described in brief below for comprehension.

### Main home loan by Bank of Maharashtra

An important point to remember is that all the schemes are provided as term loans.

- **Maha Super Housing Loan Scheme:** This is an all – purpose housing loan designed to fund the acquisition of ready to occupy house or flat, construct a new house or flat and also for extension of an existing residence.  The only type of loan under this scheme is in the form of Term Loan. It also has to be additionally ensured that the readymade house or flat is not more than 30 years old.
- **Maha Super Housing Loan Scheme for Repairs:** The name is suggestive of the primary feature of this loan. In fact it covers a gamut of activities related to your residence including repairs, renovation, furnishing, alteration etc. both to existing as well new standalone borrowers, but only on the unencumbered property. This loan is also a term loan.
- **Maha Super Housing Loan Scheme for purchase of plot and construction:** Many times the project is new with the requirement of plot and construction of house thereon. This term loan is ideally suited for such eventuality. There is a restriction of 3 years by which the construction has to be completed after the purchase of the plot. A declaration to that effect is mandatorily sought from the borrower. This loan is applicable for takeover also subject to meeting the bank’s policies. The repayment tenure for such loan will factor in by reducing the tenor by the period already enjoyed in the existing bank.
- **Maha Super Housing Loan Scheme for Top Up:** This loan primarily caters to the need of existing borrowers to enable them to repair, renovate or extend their residence. This facility is further permitted to transfer Home Loans as an additional fund to meet the evolving needs after the take-over.

### Housing Finance Scheme for NRI or PIO:

Though the categories of bank’s clientele have a range of services provided by their Maha Bharati, they are presently not covered by any housing finance scheme specifically for them. However, below are some services they provide to this important segment of their client base.

- Non Resident Ordinary (NRO) Account.
- Non Resident External (NRE) Account.
- Foreign Currency Non Resident (FCNR) Account.
- Resident Foreign Currency (RFC) Account.
- Inward Remittance
- Remittance2India: A digital interface.

### Housing Loan for High-net-worth Individuals

There is no definite description for high-net-worth individuals. In simple terms, one can be described as an HNWI if he has abundant liquid assets at his disposal. Any client who is asset rich with meager liabilities ought to be regarded as a valued customer and is offered a host of credit facilities to meet his every need. When it comes to housing finance, any single scheme cannot be designated as customized for them.

However, since their Housing Loan is not restricted to any upper limit, any of them could suit the needs of the HNWI individual subject to complying with the other rules. On the flip side, the bank is on safe ground with such loans as there are next to nil chances of default impacting the health of this loan.

### Amount of loan that can be taken under this loan scheme

The bank’s two primary Housing Finance schemes do not have any upper limit for a loan subject to the meeting other eligibility parameters.

**Bank of Maharashtra Home loan For NRI:**

At present there is no specific scheme for them.

# Bank of Maharashtra: Empowering Education Futures with Exclusive Loan Schemes

![Bank of Maharashtra: Empowering Education Futures with Exclusive Loan Schemes](https://bankofmaharashtra.in/writereaddata/defaultimages/loader.svg)

Opting for higher education is a dream that many young minds aspire to, but the staggering costs of tuition, textbooks, and hostel fees can turn this dream into a daunting challenge. Recognizing these financial needs, [Bank of Maharashtra](https://bankofmaharashtra.in/educational-loans) presents comprehensive education loans. These loans are crafted to support students who have their sights set on advanced studies within the country or abroad. Interested individuals are encouraged to visit the official website to apply for the loans: [Education Loan Scheme](https://bankofmaharashtra.in/educational-loans).

#### 100% financing, collateral-free, with special ROI concessions

The bank also offers instant in-principle sanction before registration in premier institutions in India, ensuring a seamless loan approval process for students.

#### Extended Repayment Tenures: A Boon for Students

The financial responsibility of repaying an education loan is often a source of concern for students and their families. To address this, the repayment period for these education loans has been extended to up to 15 years, excluding the moratorium period, to reduce the EMI burden on students.

#### What are considered for education loans?

- **Maha Scholar Education Loan Scheme:** The Maha Scholar Education Loan Scheme is aimed at providing financial support to meritorious students pursuing higher degree/diploma courses at premier institutions in India, such as IIMs, ISBs, IITs, NITs, XLRI, MBBS, and medical colleges.

In other word, **the option of servicing the interest is with the borrower**. The concession is available for the moratorium period only. However, minimum applicable ROI shouldn’t be below RLLR as floor rate.
- As a uniform procedure, branches should offer the option to the borrowers either to service the interest during the moratorium period as and when applied and avail 1 % concession or opt for the repayment of interest together with principal after completion of the course/moratorium. Needless to say that in later option, no interest concessions is to be provided.

**Please Note: Under both the conditions, the repayment start date in CBS (both interest and principal) should start after completion of Moratorium period only.**

- In respect of borrowers availing 1 % interest rate concession, branch should apply Interest at specified rate (without any concession) as per sanction letter. Branch should ensure that the interest is serviced as and when applied. Servicing of interest means repayment of interest amount debited to the loan account within 30 days. In eligible cases, at the time of regeneration of repayment schedule one month before repayment start date, manually interest @1% per annum will be reversed & credited to SB Account of the Borrower.
- For the purpose **BGL – 76500 -** Interest Received on Term Loan is to be adjusted through interest adjustment.
- In case borrower defaults in repayment of interest on due date for any particular month, interest concession is not to be provided for that month and on servicing of interest for any subsequent month together with interest for defaulted month(s), concession is to be provided for the month in respect of which interest has been serviced.
